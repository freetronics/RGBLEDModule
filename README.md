This is an LED with a brain! Includes a bright RGB LED on the top of
the board and a WS2801 constant-current, addressable, multi-channel
LED driver on the back. This smart module can be daisy-chained, so you
can connect a number of these together in a string and drive each of
the module colours individually from your microcontroller.

Features:

 * 3.3 to 5V operation
 * Constant current controller
 * Requires just 2 data connections: clock and data
 * Input and output headers on opposite sides of the board for easy
   daisy-chaining
